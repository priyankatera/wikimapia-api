## Wikimapia API ##

[Wikimapia.org](http://wikimapia.org) gives you an extensive set of functions that can be used in your websites and applications for accumulated geographic data.

All data that is available to you through a special system called the API (Application Programming Interface), are open and accessible to non-commercial use.

The [Wikimapia Data API](http://wikimapia.org/api) allows client applications or websites to view map data that stored in our database.

### Some examples: ###
  * A module to display additional information about objects in GPS-navigate tool
  * A website of historical places (see our news about historical layer!)
  * A mobile application for tourists visiting other countries and towns

The [Wikimapia API](http://wikimapia.org/api) Supports all most popular formats: JSON, XML, JSON-P, KML, Serialize, Binary.

## Client Libraries ##

This project was created in order to facilitate your work with the API and give the opportunity to immediately use it without first thinking about the implementation of the connection to API.

In [sources](http://code.google.com/p/wikimapia-api/source/checkout) you can find client libraries for PHP, JavaScript (using MooTools), Java and C#. Other libraries come soon!
